The cool thing was that I found it here on amazon for about $6-$7 during June! I've seen it sell here before for $24-$27. Anyways, the mask looks great and it goes very well with the wolverine muscle costume (check attached picture). The only thing to keep in mind about the mask is that the mask is a one size fits most and the chin strap might be too loose or big for some of you, like it is for me. I will most likely put on the mask and fold the chin strap a bit and use clear tape to keep it tight. lolOverall, great mask, especially if you get it under $20!

I had to cut away a significant amount of the mask around the eyes in order to make it fit better.

Not the greatest quality, but not super cheap either.  The XL was a bit big for my frame and body (5'9"" with a little beer gut), but it still looked ok.  I wouldn't recommend it for long term use, but for a party or two, it is perfect.  Note I cut off the chin strap part that hangs down, it didn't really serve any purpose and the mask was much more comfortable with it off, which cut off very cleanly and easily."

Fit true to size. Agree with others that the chin portion of the mask is awkward and not helpful. Best to cut that part off. Otherwise, love the mask!

It came with a mask, a utility belt, gauntlets, and boot covers...however, none of them were very nice.  The mask looked okay, but it was much too big.I ended up ordering this mask to go with the costume, and I am extremely impressed.  This one fits amazingly well, looks great, is easy to put on, and was a really good price.This mask fits me well, and I wear about a size 7 3/4 hat in a typical 5950 New Era baseball cap.  So, it's possible that it may be a bit large on you if you wear a significantly smaller hat size than that.Overall, I like this mask quite a bit.It fits me very well, and for reference I wear a size 7 3/4 hat in a New Era ball cap style.If you're looking for a Cap mask, give this one a shot!!!

Full Helmet fits great. Quality cheap plastic, and foam formed chest piece, with nylon print suit are great. Recommend buying gloves to match.  XL fit me at a 34/34 6""1 perfectly, with room for bigger waist and chest. Chest piece fit fine out of box, but recommend wetting it at low heat hiring the shoulders to get them crisp/mettal/flat look. Easily one of the best costumes at the party! for oly 40 bucks!

It fit perfectly based on the size chart.  The belt is not adjustable but can easily be pinned to fit or sewn to exact waist size.  The costume is nice quality for anyone that purchases it based on what we experienced.  The helmet is a little larger so we used a toboggan under the blue mask to help fill the helmet. The zipper runs down the front of the costume under flap which makes it easy for someone to put on and take off the costume without assistance.  These are only minor things to adjust so I would highly recommend it! On a side note, I did purchase the shield and boots separately from the costume so be sure to add those items to your order for a complete SUPERHERO look.

I figured that would be the case when I ordered it, though, and had planned all along on building or making the parts that I wanted to replace.The body suit itself, though, is really nice.  It's well put together, looks great, and seems to have pretty good quality materials.  It fit me well, although I am trying to lose some weight so that it fits me even better.  The zipper on it functions perfectly, and nothing is ripped or broken.  My mother is a fairly good seamstress, and I took it to her to have her check it out and she found nothing that needed to be reworked or changed right off the bat.Overall, I'm really happy with the purchase.  The other parts that I've been working on are coming out really well, too.  I feel that when I'm done the whole thing will look amazing!!!"

It arrived and the quality of the costume did impress, compared to your typical halloween outfit.. until I tried it on. The actual suit is fine for the most part but the accessories, such as the rubber gauntlets and shin guards are a joke. I literally laughed out loud at how poor the quality the gloves were. The gloves were too tight for my hands, yet too long for my fingers. The belt almost never stayed on and I ended up stapling the velcro ends so it would stop falling off.I'm 6'3'' and I lift weights so I filled the costume out just fine. I actually filled it out a little TOO well, specifically around the neck which is so tight, it won't close. The thighs were a bit slimmer than expected. It's also tight in the crotch so keep that in mind if you're self-conscious about wearing pants that leave too little to the imagination. If you are physically fit, it will be apparent. If you are not physically fit, it will be apparent.The costume is great fun to put on, with all the pulling and twisting and zipping but keep an eye out on the zipper which easily snaps off. It's also quite comfortable and feels like thick pajamas. Please keep in mind that the belt is molded plastic and the the zippers on the thigh are non-functional so keep an eye on your keys and your smartphone since you'll have nowhere to carry them on the costume. The gloves don't play nice with capacitive smartphone screens so be ready to take a glove off constantly.Also: the eye holes in the much too large mask are very poorly cut. I ended up finishing the job myself with kitchen shears.Once I got over the disappointment of how poor the accessories were assembled, I geared up and headed out the door.Here's what happened: I got swarmed by kids, I had lots of photos taken of and with me, I had my rear squeezed like 13 times, and I have never had so many folks buy me a drink while bar hopping. The costume really pops and is a conversation starter for sure. It's fun for a night out and I had fun but the quality of the piece doesn't inspire confidence in how long this will last and it ended up falling apart in the span of a few hours simply walking around, dancing a bit and drinking.Based on my experience with the Captain America outfit, I would NOT buy a costume at this price from Disguise in the future due to the poor quality of accessories and bizarre size issues.while bar hopping.

Based on previous reviews, I ordered an XL, but it was almost too small.  It fit fine, but I definitely would not have fit in a large.  Costume is pretty awesome, lots of good comments.  The mask was also in good shape, not flattened like I've seen other masked that were shipped.

The costume was a hit while trick or treating with my kids. It's good to order green body paint since they will see your hands and your neck area. It's nice to green everything out and wear a pair of boots. The costume made it through Halloween and we are holding on to it just in case for another party

However, my main complaint was how HOT it was.  The material is not breathable.The mask was also a bit tight (and hot).  I ended up only wearing it for about an hour.

I bought this for a kaleidodash 5k fun foam run and it weathered  very well. I thought I would have to discard it after the race but I was able to wash it for reuse.

I got the Medium (I wear a size 8 in dresses). There was a lot of extra material but with the belt and the cape I was able to hide it. The length was perfect in the front but my ""hump"" made the back a lot shorter. Again, the cape came to the rescue and covered me up. I also wore pantyhose to feel more secure.  I have thick thighs and chubby knees so I had to SLIGHTLY (and carefully) snip the very top of the boot covers for them to fit perfectly...and it worked. Great product!"

Features are nicely detailed and the effect is very realistic even up close.  The big problem is that ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT EVERY HEAD!.  The eye holes have to be lined up with your eyes or you can't see out of them.  If the ""head"" part is too large, (as it is in my case) the mask part will not stay in proper position. The only thing that might work is to stuff the large head cavity with foam or something similar before putting it over your head so that it sits higher.There are velcro strips in the back (to hold the hood closed, I assume?), but they are sewn on in such a way as to be virtually useless."

There is a fantastic video on YouTube that shows how to tailor fit this mask to any size head with just a pair of scizzors and gorilla glue. Seriously anyone looking for a batman cowl, this one is the one for you.Quick tip if you receive it and the ears or mask has unnatural bends in it, blow a Ballon up in the mask and leave it over night. For the ears get some cheap density foam at michaels or joanns  and cut it to fit the ears and through the inside of the mask fill the ears and they will be golden. Imperfections within the integrity of the mask can also be fixed with a can of plastidip. Keep the ballon in and simply and lightly do 3-5 coats of platidip on the cowl. The plastidip will naturally expand the latex as it dries and pull out any bumps lips etc. It will also give it a nice smooth look eith no bumps or lumps that latex masks can get. This mask easily can look better then a 300$ custom made one.

I'm a bigger guy 6'3/6'4 and 250+, so I have a rather large head so I sort of knew any ""off the shelf"" batman mask was going to be a crap shoot as far as fitment. Well the masked arrived in pretty poor shape. which was expected by looking at other reviews. It came loose in a plastic bag inside of a box and was sort of deformed. I stuffed the floppy ears with tissue and I had to enlarge the eye area in order for the mask to fit my head at all. Overall as long as you don't expect a movie quality prop, this mask doesn't disappoint for the price. With a little work it can make for a decent looking mask, just be warned that it runs on the small side."

Based on other reviews, I ordered a size up and got a large. That proved to be a good decision, as the large fit perfectly, so beware the shirts run small! I think a medium would have been way too tight. I bought it for a silly party and for the price, you can't really beat it as a cheap, fun costume (I paired it with some cheap green tights and a black mini). The cape is removable, and the mask is really soft and light. The elastic band had adjustable velcro, so it was super comfy. I ended up wearing it all night, never having to take it off. Love this!

However, it was for an adult Batman party and I have to say everyone enjoyed goofing off in the cape and mask for group photos. Knocked off a star for cape being too small for everyone's throat but the mask was perfect!
