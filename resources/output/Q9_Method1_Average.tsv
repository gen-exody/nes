She's 5'11 and very weighs 160lbs with long limbs. The size medium I bought her fits great! Plus she's very picky and actually said that she likes it immediately.  ""that never happens""! Oh she did make one comment that she wishes the hood was larger. Great Value!"

It's roomy enough to wear a sweatshirt underneath, but not really loose or bulky with just a T-shirt underneath. I had a similar kind of jacket, but a different brand which would barely allow for wearing a T-shirt underneath, and wasn't all that windproof. I primarily bought this as a raincoat for warmer weather, but I've enjoyed how windproof it is. I typically bike home from work well after sunset, so temps are slightly above freezing, but I get much more windchill biking when it's windy vs walking. I've stayed plenty warm with just a sweatshirt under this jacket on my ride home. It also kept me very dry in the rain. I haven't gotten to zip off the hood, but that seems handy, and the jacket is made so it looks OK with it removed.

We've had it for a few weeks, and I'm very impressed.The first thing you'll notice with this jacket is the extreme light weight, which my daughter really appreciates.  There's nothing worse than having to sweat through a heavy rain jacket on an 80-degree day, and that's definitely not a problem with this offering from Columbia.  Between the extreme light weight and the vent in the back, the wearer is able to keep both cool and dry.  The material also does an excellent job of repelling water, and it shakes off nicely.We purchased the medium size for my daughter who usually wears a 7/8, and the fit has been excellent.  It conforms nicely to whatever she's wearing, and the material is flexible enough that it's not tight if she's wearing a sweater underneath.  I also like that the hood stays on well, and doesn't tend to slip down with the slightest breeze.  This is an easy five-star product for us, and I wish all clothing purchases worked out this well.

She wants to wear it when it isn't raining. I like this raincoat because when the weather is nice but raining, she can wear it without being hot, as with a regular, thick raincoat. This one can go on over a sweater or a shirt when the Spring rain comes.

She made it her  special raincoat so she wears it on special occasions. It fitted her great, the size I got has room for growth so she'll have her precious Frozen Jacket for a few years....then we'll buy her a new size to keep her smiling.

Slightly over sized which I hoped for anyway.  Gives her room to grow and will last awhile assuming the material holds it own.  Very thin.  Wears like a coat, more like a poncho.  Buttons aren't the greatest, and look like they'll eventually rip.  For the price I am satisfied.

The jacket fits perfectly over his shirts, and the sleeves are long enough too.  An unexpected bonus is that the hood has a small brim on the front which will help keep the rain off of his face.  The jacket zips in the front, and also has Velcro closures too.  The jacket has a mesh lining which I believe will make it cooler in the summer rains.  Very happy with this purchase."

I like that it has inner pockets and a space to write his name in it.  I hadn't had the opportunity to put it on him in the  rain yet. My six year old son is tall for his age. I've been told by anyone who has seen him, so it's not just me that believes so. I ordered the medium that is suppose to fit a size 10-12. I may have but just this upcoming school year for him to wear it if he continues to grow at this weed-like pace.  It fits more like a size 10. I like that it covers his bottom and the sleeves are plenty long. I would buy it again.

From all reports she stayed dry and she loved the color. It wasn't too hot either (it was in the 80's that day) which is a bonus. The pouch is convenient for packing and, as I discovered when she returned from her trip, can stand up to having the pullover shoved and wrinkled up inside of it. When I pulled it out of the sack two days later there were no holes in the pullover from the rough treatment.

I was glad to not have to use it for that but very glad to have in my car now. I'm not one to carry an umbrella so this works great for a run in to the store during a downpour. Protects very well against rain and seals right up to keep the wind out. I love how lightweight it is and yet still very durable. I can see myself using this for many years to come.

It was expensive then, but they work great. Super light, breathable and comfortable material. My son went to Disney World and stayed dry in those torrential downpours. Compare that to the Disney World rain poncho. He wore that in Animal Kingdom and within 20 minutes he was wet up to his chest. Unlike other rainsuits, Frogg Toggs has good, strong zippers in the jackets. I tested the new ones by putting my hand covered with part of the rainsuit in a bowl of water for 30 seconds. Hand stayed totally dry! The stuff looks flimsy and light but it's actually quite strong. My son wore it for 2 weeks in Disney World, where it rained hard almost every day. He's no careful with his stuff, but the rainsuit never had a scratch even though I always shove it roughly into a bag when the rain stop. (The Disney World ponchos broke in no time).They do run big, but remember, you are wearing it over regular clothes, so being big allows for easy movements, which is important. It doesn't look fitting, but it keeps you bone dry, and dry looks much better than soaking wet.My son is 9, short for his age, and I ordered him the Medium (his old one is getting small). They are big on him, but he can walk around no problem because the leg bottom has elastic that bunches up. And he can keep his hands in his sleeves to keep them dry. He says he likes it. He hasn't forgotten what it's like to be wet to the chest.I highly recommend this product if you are up against some powerful rain. If you just have an occasional light drizzle, this is probably overkill. And the Amazon price is about half of what I paid long ago.

Wonderful that it is lined with a soft jersey material. And outside is not that cheap looking raincoat material, it's matte.  My son is 3, and small. Would have ordered the 4, but I had just ordered a four in another brand and I won't get another season out of it. So although the five is big, he'll definetly wear it until he's 5, and with rolled sleeves it's fine! He loooooves it!

The wrists and waist are both adjustable (with velcro and elastic, respectively.) There is also a velcro placket which fastens over the zipper for added dryness.This is the perfect jacket for summer monsoons. The mesh interior will not cause you to overheat. It also allows some room to put on a sweater underneath if necessary.I've seen a handful of reviews saying they were disappointed that this jacket wasn't warm enough so let me be very clear: THIS IS NOT A WARM JACKET BECAUSE IT ISN'T TRYNG TO BE. Isn't the difference between a rain coat and a winter coat the warmth factor? If you want something for skiing - this probably ain't it. But if you want a jacket that'll keep your clothes dry in the absence of a biting, Arctic cold, this is your jacket

I have several other Colombia jackets and this one fits the same. I have worn this jacket for hiking and everyday wear. It works great as a windbreaker and rain coat. It is also lightweight and can easily be packed into your day pack.A few downsides.....The description said that it packs into itself but I have not found a way to do this. They want you to attempt to pack it into one of the pockets which I have not found a way to do. Another minor annoyance is the drawstrings. There is no good way to hold them back which gets annoying, particularly the ones on the hood.
