I bought this for my granddaughters baby baptism. It arrived in a timely manner, was of excellent quality, fit perfectly, and was quite reasonably priced. It was special for the baptism because of the lace trim. It was worn under her baptism gown but at the restaurant her mom removed the gown and she was in her lace trimmed onesie for a bit, and was still very special.

Now that it's warmer weather full on footie pajamas are a little too warm to wear under her wearable blankets, but she still needs her arms covered at night. These are perfect! And the fabric is so soft! I bought the 6-12 month size and they are a little big on her now but that just means she'll get a lot of use out of these before her first birthday. I highly recommend these.Update to add: We have loved these so much we have now purchased the next size up so our little one can keep wearing them!

They just kick them off!

These make nighttime changing super easy and the size is great. They are a bit too large for brand-new babes but after only a few weeks they should be fine and fit all the way up to 6+months (depending on your little one of course!)

I bought two sets of these because they are absolutely perfect for sleeping and are so adorable! The material is wonderful for maintaining baby's temperature as it is super breathable. I didn't know until I used these that the sleeves have little caps on the end to your cover baby's hands if they tend to scratch themselves, or you can keep them unfolded and let baby reach and grab as he pleases! These make nighttime changing super easy and the size is great. They are a bit too large for brand-new babes but after only a few weeks they should be fine and fit all the way up to 6+months (depending on your little one of course!)

Only complaint is that with the buttons she's able to get a foot out in between the buttons.
