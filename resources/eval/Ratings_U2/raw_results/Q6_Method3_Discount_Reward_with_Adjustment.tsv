A very good coat for its cost which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.

In that role it functions very well.  The jacket is extremely light, but adds a good layer of warmth.  I'll probably use the jacket by itself during the spring or fall, as it fits my 5' 11"" 160 lb frame well, and is stylish in it's own right.  I only gave it four stars as the price seemed a little out of line."

Definitely my favorite jacket as it is soooo light and thin.  The self packing feature is convenient. Can't wait to try this out when camping. I've worn it in winter in Spokane and Colorado Springs. It is so comfortable it makes me wonder if there are gloves that have down in them because I have big thick gloves that keep you warm but give you hot dog fingers. I do have tiny bits of down come out every once in a while but it will take years and years before that will affect performance. I personally don't like the puffy jacket look but I don't care anymore because it is so comfortable. I got a medium and I usually wear large for t-shirts.

It has a light feel, and under the shell, provides comfort in the 20s.  For the sale price I paid, it has been a high rate of return product so far.  I'm 6'1"" 170 lbs -- sleeve length and overall fit is excellent."

Could be a little warmer though for Chicago winters.  I have used it a lot so far as a layer along with either a fleece vest or used with an outer shell.  Like all packable puffy down jackets it is super lightweight.  When you first unpack the jacket it is really flat and doesn't look too great.  After wearing it one or two times it fluffs up nicely.  I bought another one in blue for my son as well.

This guy is so light weight, i hardly even realize its on. I'm a pretty athletic individual, as such, i have a high metabolism and i do not need a giant coat for most weather so for me personally, it keeps me warm in weather as low as 30-40 degrees (i'm from texas, our winters don't get much worse than that).Can't speak to other individual's uses, but i love it.

It protects against the cold very well and stuffs within its own left pocket for very good storage. Never appreciated how great down was before I used this jacket.

Just got back from a section hike on the Appalachian Trail.  I thru hiked several years ago and wish I had this with me.  The cuffs are a little large.  The jacket does get rips/burns easily so if I am around a campfire or in briars I throw a light windbreaker over it.  I will be getting a few more of these. Very warm, lightweight and packs down to a small size.  You can't beat the price.   Also, if you get a rip/burn just use tenacious tape on it.

It weighs about nothing, it compresses down into a small carry bag, takes virtually no room to store and was more than adequate on my 14,000 + elevation in 15 mph winds at @ 40 degrees and again at 10,000 + ft @ +/- 30 degrees. Excellent addition to my pack! Highly recommended for anyone for 3 season camping.

A lot of reviews that said it was somewhat large for their size almost tempted me to get a large instead of an extra large.  Man I'm glad I didn't listen, because this thing fits me like I expect an extra large to fit me.  Not too tight, but not like wearing a 50 gallon garbage sack either.  I am 6'-1"", 212 lbs with a muscular build, and it fits perfectly.  I could wear layers under this if I wanted to, but it also feels like I could wear this under a parka shell as the base layer.Quality:  3 stars for quality.  Mainly, they went super chinsy on the amount of down in each chamber.  I don't care too much because this is simply a warm, extra-light layer for backpacking in my case, but I can't see this keeping you too warm if the weather got down into the freezing range.  I know this jacket was only $70 compared to most other jackets which are well over $150.  But even for $70 you'd think they could stuff a bit more down into the chambers because it's not puffy in the slightest."

It fit him in almost every way except for the waist. He has broad shoulders but slimmer waist, so it was very loose and airy. I then bought him the jacket (also in Medium) to see if it would fit better, but it had the same problem, so I returned both the vest and jacket.

Intially,  I thought because it was so thin, that I could only wear it in maybe mid 30 or 40 degrees weather, but today it truly passed the test in 10 degree weather with me wearing just a light sweater and a Tshirt;  now the wind chill factor wasn't bad today, but it was frigid cold outside.

I live in Boston, so this coat is a little thin for those bitter winter days, however it is so lightweight and comfortable that I even dare wear it through blizzards. Definitely as warm as a North Face jacket, though perhaps not as much as one of those thick puffer coats that turn you into a marshmallow.I was actually surprised at how warm it was, because it is incredibly thin. When I first tried it on, I was nervous that this would be a bad buy as the jacket itself is almost paper thin, though afterwards I found myself sweating in minutes.Warm, thin, light, a great coat. Definitely packable too, though a bag wasn't included.

Is super lightweight, packs down to nothing (easily fits in a purse) and kept me dry.  The only thing I would caution is that the zippers tend to catch on the fabric, especially the pockets, so use them minimally or prepare for a few snags.

This is not represented as a winter coat replacement; but as a spring/fall weight  jacket, or a mid layer; it is perfect.  The product I received is well made (seams are uniform and well sewn).  I wore the sweater/shirt about 5 times the week I received it and did not experience any down poking through the nylon material or seams.  This has become my go-to alternative to a sweater or as a mid-layer under a heavier coat when it is really frigid outside.

So far is has been the perfect spring jacket for my husband. I think it would also work well under a winter shell type jacket, my husband has a work jacket that is like a thicker wind breaker but doesn't tend to be very warm, so combined I think it would make a great pair for winter when it's sometimes really cold and sometimes not, I received this product at a discount for my honest review, I was not compensated in any way.
