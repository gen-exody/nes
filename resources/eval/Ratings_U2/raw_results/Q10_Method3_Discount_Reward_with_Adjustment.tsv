If you have mild winters like I do in California, then this is the perfect fall/winter jacket. Try not to wash it too much though, the zippers and stitching are cheaply made, and will fall off if not done carefully.

I read the reviews before buying, which was a good though cause I bought the next size up from his normal size (he normally wears a large, sometimes a medium but I bought a XL). It did the trick, and not bad quality for how cheap it is.

The Chinese XL was way too small - more an US Medium.  And it's really not returnable, since it goes back to China.

It's a dark green and like everyone says, runs small.  However, I had bought an XL from a different Chinese merchant and it fits perfectly.  This one is even smaller.  I am 5'9"" and 175, with a muscular frame and wide shoulders and lats. I can get the coat on, but it's tight.  It's right on the border of fitting, but really will only do over a t shirt or lighter shirt.  I'm keeping it because it was cheap and still looks pretty good.  I bought it as an accessory rather than a functional jacket.  An XXL would have been perfect."

Since I sized up, it fits great!  Hits at the top of my hips (5'7, 130lbs).  The hood is actually big enough to cover my head (some other imports like this one have tiny, useless hoods), and the arms are long enough for my super long arms.  It's not lined, and feels a bit more like a heavy shirt, but for the price I really can't complain.

I am 5ft6, 140 lbs, and I got Chinese M size.  Initially I got the Chinese L, but the fit was kinda too baggy for my liking.  I returned it and got the Chinese M, which fits really nice, not too baggy, which I feel makes the look of the jacket even better.  It is quite stylish and the craftsmanship is not bad, coming from a China.  The sleeves are slim, but the waist part is a bit baggy for my liking.  Nontheless, I still like it because of how cool it looks.  For the price, you cannot get a better deal.I bought the green, and liked it so much, I also purchased one in black.

But like most foreign clothing the sizing is tricky, OK so I'm a average build 5'8 male not necessarily wide in the shoulders, I'm actually sort of a slim build all around. I would normally buy a US. Men's size small Jacket and it would fit and then some. But this said to order 2 sizes larger so I ordered a large. Upon receiving the item it was still too small being short on the arms, and in the shoulders. So honestly I would recommend buying 3 sizes larger for a good fit. It seems kind of crazy but you probably will need  it.

I recommend getting two sizes larger than you would usually buy for this to fit properly. My only complaint is the inside pocket, while it is very convenient and spacious, the material inside the fabric tears easily. Basically don't cram too much stuff into the inner pocket and you should be fine.P.S. The zippers on the front are just for show.

I'm 5'10, 190 and pretty fit, I ordered a medium and it fit as expected. If you're wearing a vest underneath I'd order a size larger as it is cut on the tighter side. Carried my personal weapon with a spare mag and set of cuffs with no printing issues using the inner zippered pockets.

This jacket was perfect. I'm right between a medium and large in shirts and I ordered a medium and it fits great. Its extremely efficient at keeping me warm especially for a light jacket. I would highly recommend this jacket. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the collar does not flatten all the way, but it is close enough that it can be managable. Maybe making the hood fully detachable would be a good option if you don't plan on ever using it.

His size is usually medium but I went with large on this jacket and it was a good call.  He's a weight lifter so he's big in his shoulders and small at hip and large fits him perfect.  Washed it once and it did not change size. Nice color but some of the dark stains are hard to get out.  I would have gone with darker color but he liked than one.

I saw from the description it was coming from Asia and expected much smaller sizes so I was not startled.  The appearance is wonderful. The stitched lines are flattering, not like so many of the puffy coats I see that are all stitched horizontal.  Horizontal anything is a no no in my book.  The angled stitches and criss cross stitches really make the coat look beautiful.  It is super soft.  It lost a star because I can give no feedback on warmth.

Not only does it fit very small, but it just fits awkward. In addition, the hood has a very nontraditional fit, which looks incredibly silly when actually worn. This is in addition to the fact that the material is the same material that you find in Halloween costumes (super cheap feeling) and the buttons are made of cheap plastic and seem to be dangling from a single piece of string.I'm not sure if this Hoodie is actually made to be worn, perhaps it really is a Halloween costume, made to be worn once.
