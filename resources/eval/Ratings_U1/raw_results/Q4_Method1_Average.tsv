I bought two sets of these because they are absolutely perfect for sleeping and are so adorable! The material is wonderful for maintaining baby's temperature as it is super breathable. I didn't know until I used these that the sleeves have little caps on the end to your cover baby's hands if they tend to scratch themselves, or you can keep them unfolded and let baby reach and grab as he pleases! These make nighttime changing super easy and the size is great. They are a bit too large for brand-new babes but after only a few weeks they should be fine and fit all the way up to 6+months (depending on your little one of course!)

I bought this for my granddaughters baby baptism. It arrived in a timely manner, was of excellent quality, fit perfectly, and was quite reasonably priced. It was special for the baptism because of the lace trim. It was worn under her baptism gown but at the restaurant her mom removed the gown and she was in her lace trimmed onesie for a bit, and was still very special.

We used them under her clothes in the chilly autumn and winter weather and couldn't have been happier. It's really nice to have the option to size them up between the legs. We were able to get a few extra weeks out of them thanks to this option.
