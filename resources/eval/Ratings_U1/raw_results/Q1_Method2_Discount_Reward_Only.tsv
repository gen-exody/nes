He LOVES them. Such a fun change from the typical black dress sock. These socks came in a great variety of colors and styles and are good quality.

I will purchase more in the future. The weather is so hot this summer; especially in the South (Georgia, USA) and these socks with sandals are the answer for me.

But it's a little bit fragile, got holes on it after a week.

Needed some sock that wouldn't be too hot in summer, nor too cold in winter. These seem to do the trick.

Nice and breathable, and also have nice elasticity so they won't fall down. They do ride above the calf and can be stretched to the knee, so while they are a bit longer than I expected I still like them. Perfect as a dress sock and fit nice inside dress shoes. I just bought more.

So I imagine it could be quite a squeeze for thicker boned people.

Cotton socks have helped keep his feet dry. However, being 100% cotton they stretch and loosen after washing and wearing them. They don't fall down or pool at the ankles, but it isn't snug and this can be annoying. You win some with the breathability of the cotton, but lose some because it stretches and doesn't bounce back. We're still in search of the perfect socks.

He tells me that he likes these socks, especially the fit..  Since he has a wide foot, some socks don't meet his expectations.  But these do fit and are comfortable.  Because these socks were such a great value, I hesitated before buying them.  But,  I am glad I made the purchase.

They are basic black socks, not gray like the photo. They are are a bit snug on the legs, but not tight like support hose. They stay up reasonably well, but do tend to creep down a bit during a long day - not annoying - more or less like other socks that I've had. Like other reviewers, I only keep one type of black socks so I never need to pair or match them up, and these are serving me well.A good deal for the money.

They are soft and comfy yet made of strong material. They are so comffy that you forget your wearing them and they fit like a glove. I even used these for work and they supprisingly didnt make my feet sweat or create a nasty odor which other socks give. These fold up like other socks and I recommedn these for everyone both ale and female. They are not too thick and not too thin there perfect.

Fit perfectly. My neuropathy burns and I live in a hot climate, so I was hoping they'd be so thin they were transparent, as they appear in the picture, but they're not. Exactly like my Hanes low rise socks. Very good price and quick delivery. I always wish these kinds of things came in navy, but it's always just white, or white and black.

It said they were the perfect length for him (he hates ankle socks), and they were the perfect material and thickness, one thing he can;t stand is thick bulky socks that make your feet sweat. Not only are these socks soft, comfortable and light but you can't beat the price, honestly for the quality of these socks it is a steal and I am planning on buying his socks from here continuously.PROS:- Soft material- light and breathable- perfect length above the ankle- comfortable to wear- do not fade in color or threading after washing- UNBEATABLE PRICEcons:nothing at allThese socks are the real deal, if my picky dad loves them so would you! They are light, breathable, soft comfortable and high quality!

They are high quality and just the right thickness. I bought these for my husband and we did find they are a little big but not to bad that he can't use them. The cotton is breathable so his feet aren't sweating which is a huge plus living in Florida. My husband is on his feet constantly and he is always wearing out socks fast but I am not seeing any wear and tear in these socks and he has been using them since we got them. I have washed them multiple times and we had no shrinking and no color loss they are still just as black as the first day we got them. I would definitely recommend this brand of socks. We are both impressed. I purchased this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I was not paid or sponsored for my opinions all thoughts reflected in this review are my own.

I ordered the 10 - 13 size socks and the length is OK. However, there is no choice for width and a EXXX would have be much more comfortable. Otherwise, a great sock. Like wearing a sock within a sock and they pull the moisture away from the feet.

They are comfortable though and wick moisture away from your feet very well. I originally gave these a one-star rating due to the fit, but after wearing them for a couple of weeks I've change my mind. My advice would be to order a one size larger than normal.

He is either loosing them, or wear them to the point he has holes. So far these socks have held up longer than any other brand of socks we have bought him. The pack comes with 12 pair vs 6 pairs like the store brands. This means less wearing over and over so the socks don't wear out. The less wash and wear the longer the life span. The socks fit my husband who has really large feet. We usually have to buy multiple different kinds just to get pairs that mostly fit. I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review.

These cotton socks from Stanzino were a great choice to keep his toes happy!When we buy my husband shoes, we tend to purchase between size 11-13 in men's depending on the manufacturer. These socks were a tiny bit small on him and the heel seam didn't come high enough to rest exactly on his heel, but it wasn't bad enough where he couldn't wear them and he even reported that they were more comfortable by the end of the day. The tops cover his ankles without going too high. The cotton material is soft and really helps to keep his feet comfortable whether he's in boots or low-tops!We're so glad to be able to add twelve pairs of these to his wardrobe! It's nice to have a large quantity of good, black cotton socks! We did receive this product at a discount but price doesn't change how comfortable they are, nor does it effect my review!

These seem to fit the bill. They are shedding a lot of lint on my feet in the initial wearings, but hopeful this will stop after I have washed them a few times. I cannot yet say how durable they will be, but they seem well made. So far I am happy with them. The sort of old-school cotton crew socks that used to be very easy to find but are now rather rare.

These are the best I've found so far. They're not padded, but they are substantial and definitely thicker than dress socks. They're very soft, stay up well, and wash well in cold water. I'm a woman's size 8.5 shoe, and the men's 7-12 are a little bit big, but they work. I'm 5'6"", and these are almost long enough to be knee socks on me. My only complaint is that the tops are tight in the ankles and calves, and I have very skinny calves, as in, most boots are too big around the calves on me."

They fit comfortably and are just the right thickness.  They absorb moisture so your feet stay drier.  They are also breathable so they don't make you too hot.  They have spandex in them so they stay up but aren't too tight.  My son loves how they fit.  For the price for 12 of them you can't beat that!!  They are nice socks!! I received this product complementary exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review. These are just my own opinions and based on my personal experience.

And, if I need to pull them a little harder, they won't last long.

They have a high cotton content, so they breath.  I thought they felt a little rough on the first wearing, but softened after washing with no noticeable shrinkage.  They stayed in place while exercising and didn't slide down.  I can't say that I got any special support, fashion points, or shock absorbing benefits from them, like it says in the description.

Summer or winter that is all I wear now.  The difference between merino wool and cotton is amazing.  I'll never go back to damp, clammy cotton socks again!

Orignally got them for summer hiking, now I wear them any time 1) socks are needed and 2) business attire is not required.  They lose some of their springiness over months/years, but remain comfortable and serviceable.

They fulfill the need for something not too warm for the spring, but still provide coverage and comfort. The material is very thin, not thick flannel. They have a good length and the material is soft and has a bit of stretch.
